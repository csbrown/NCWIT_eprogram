Todd Vawdrey,West High School,"Todd Vawdrey is a Computer Science and Math teacher at West High School. He was the Utah ACTE IT Division President from 2019 to 2021. To increase the gender diversity in CS courses, he advises:
• The best recruiter for female students is other female students.  Getting a few girls excited will help them bring their friends and fellow students.
• After school clubs which promote women in STEM are very effective.  SheTech and Girls Who Code have easy entry points and promote gender diversity in STEM.
• Look for connections with other clubs and recruit from their members.  Girls who will are successful in Robotics, Science Olympiad, and other STEM classes will probably enjoy your classes too.",ToddVawdry.jpg
