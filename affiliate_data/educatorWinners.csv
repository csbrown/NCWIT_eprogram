Landon Ashcroft,Intech Collegiate High School,"Landon Ashcroft has been teaching engineering at InTech Collegiate Academy for over ten  years. A graduate of USU, Landon has always been drawn to engineering because he loves to do things himself: from repairing his own cars, to remodeling RVs, he always found that knowledge is  power. His desire to empower others is what led him to teach. Early in his career, Landon recognized that while his female students often had a strong aptitude for STEM, they didn’t have much confidence in their abilities. He worked to encourage more girls to join InTech’s FIRST Robotics team, which led to InTech having the only team with all-girl leadership in Utah. His students have gone on to study at institutions like MIT, and have won hundreds of thousands of dollars in scholarships. Five of them have been nominated for NCWIT awards since 2017. And he’s proud to say, many more of them change their own oil to this day. His commitment to helping women, people of color, and the LGBTQ+ community to access opportunities in engineering is unwavering.",LandonAshcroft.jpg
